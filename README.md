# Countdown Timer Exercise

<p>This is a repository for a simple countdown timer.</p>

<p>The timer is created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

### Design

#### Shout out to [Blast TV](https://blast.tv/) for the design inspiraton!

<p>The main idea of the exercise was to practice JavaScript & CSS.
The main setback was how to separate each number in the timer, so I could style the gradient borders for each number container as in the design.</p>
